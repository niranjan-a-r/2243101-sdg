                The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the world’s best plan to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030. 
                Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to promote prosperity while protecting the environment. 
                They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, equality and job opportunities while tackling climate change and working to preserve our ocean and forests.
                The SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. 
                Through the pledge to Leave No One Behind, countries have committed to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first.
                That is why the SDGs are designed to bring the world to several life-changing ‘zeros’, including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination against women and girls.<br> There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals:
